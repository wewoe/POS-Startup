# POS-Startup
I have an idea to build a best startup, which is Pos app. I know it sounds so boring and outdated. But I have used almost 50+ pos apps, i find all apps lack somthing, there is no app that can be helpful in tier3-4 cities. Everyone focus on tier 1-2 cities. I would like to make an POS app that an uneducated person can easily use.
