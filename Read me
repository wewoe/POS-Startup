Hi, I am Adnan Ansari. My father is a retail business owner. To help him, I used multiple POS Apps but everyapp have not all features or high price. i would like to start an Pos app that have Easy to Use UI and UX, so uneducated Staff can just touch the product image and Enter Price, and print Bill. I have checked almost 50+ apps like Vyapaar, Ezo Billing app, Peddler Pos, etc. I found that these apps Focus on the business which are in tier 1-2 Cities, their ui is not for uneducated. Some apps have very High Cost. But foreign apps like SpicePos and Loyverse POS have very-very easy to use, and fast. Anyone like uneducated can also use very easily. But their subscription price is not for Indian market. So I would like to create an POS app which is very easy to use, for Uneducated and Old age people. I don't have an much budget, but i need someone who can collaborate with my idea. I have used almost 50+Apps and software of POS and Billing. I know what are the issues in every app. Please Give me a chance, and its can be your best Investment, I can guarantee you. Everyone Focuses on Window based Software. But if you work with me, I can help you to make the best - out of best App, where no marketing is required to promote, because our app can dominate the whole market. Please consider my idea. Please reply me as soon as possible.
